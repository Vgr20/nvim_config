Hi there this is my configuration files for my NVIM Configuration.
I have been using NVIM for a while now and I have been loving it.

I have been using the following plugins:
- NvimTree
- Telescope
- LSP
- Mason
- MasonLSPConfig
- Bufferline
- Comment
- Lualine
- Toggleterm
- Treesitter
- Gruvbox (GUI Theme)
- Githup Copilot

I have also been using some custom keybindings that I have been using for a while now. Please refer to the keybindings section for more information.

_Happy Coding!_
